# Assignment 2

This program was compiled on Arch Linux x86_64 11th Gen Intel i7-1195G7 (8) @ 5GHz. 
Run with `./a2`. 

I added additional classes, `Point` and `Direction`, since geometrically they're 
different objects and I believe it's better practice than overloading the `Vector` 
class. The funcionality is unchanged.
